🔍 Key Insights

Applicants with higher CIBIL scores have a significantly higher approval probability.

Overall approval rate is 62%.

Approved loans generally have slightly longer loan terms.

Income shows weak correlation with loan amount — high income ≠ approval.

Some high-income applicants were still rejected due to poor credit scores.

Applicants with fewer dependents tend to request lower loan amounts.
